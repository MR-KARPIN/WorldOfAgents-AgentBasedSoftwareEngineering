## Introduction

JADE Project for ABSD groups ready to be imported from Git as Gradle-build project in Intellij IDEA.

## Structure

- `out`: .jar artifacts to export the agents and run the game.
- `src.es.upm.emse.absd`: root module with the .java files to develop
    - `teamX`: module directory of each group.
    - `Main.java`: configurable main class that launches the project and imported agents from other teams.
    - `Utils.java`: Utility class to implement reusable functions.
